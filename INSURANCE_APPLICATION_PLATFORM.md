### **3. Grounded AI Architecture**
```
User Query → SPARQL Facts → Business Calculations → Grounded Response
     ↓              ↓              ↓                    ↓
"What's my    Extract policy   Calculate reserve    "Based on policy
 claim        coverage from    using severity       XYZ123 (IRI: ...)
 reserve?"    knowledge graph  tables + modifiers   reserve is £4,600"
```

**AI Grounding Requirements**:
- All responses must cite specific graph facts (IRIs)
- Calculations must use verified business logic tools
- Missing data triggers targeted follow-up questions
- Complete audit trail for regulatory compliance
