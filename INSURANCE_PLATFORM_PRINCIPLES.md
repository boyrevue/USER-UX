# CLIENT-UX Insurance Platform: Principles & Architecture

## 🎯 **Core Principles**

### **1. Ontology-First Development**
```
Traditional Approach:        Ontology-Driven Approach:
Code → Database → UI    →    Ontology → Code → Database → UI
```

**Principle**: All business logic, validation rules, and UI definitions originate from semantic ontologies stored in TTL files.

**Benefits**:
- **Single Source of Truth**: No duplication of business rules across layers
- **Semantic Consistency**: Standardized vocabulary eliminates ambiguity
- **Rapid Adaptation**: Business rule changes require only ontology updates
- **AI Transparency**: Every decision traceable to formal knowledge representation

### **2. Grounded AI Architecture**
```
Traditional AI:              Grounded AI:
Input → Black Box → Output   Input → Facts + Rules + Calculations → Auditable Output
```

**Principle**: All AI responses must be grounded in verifiable facts from the knowledge graph with complete audit trails.

**Implementation**:
- **Mandatory SPARQL**: All AI queries must retrieve facts from RDF graph
- **Calculation Tools**: Numerical assessments use verified business logic services
- **Fact Citations**: Every response lists IRIs of facts used in reasoning
- **Follow-up Logic**: Missing data triggers targeted questions, not assumptions

### **3. SHACL-Driven Validation**
```
Code-Based Validation:       SHACL Validation:
if (age < 17) error()   →    sh:minInclusive 17 ; sh:message "Must be 17+"
```

**Principle**: Data quality and business rules enforced through SHACL shapes, not imperative code.

**Advantages**:
- **Declarative Rules**: Business logic expressed as constraints, not procedures
- **Automatic Validation**: Real-time data quality checking
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Rules map directly to legal requirements
- **Multi-language Support**: Same rules work across different programming languages

### **4. Privacy-by-Design (GDPR)**
```
Field-Level Classification:
autoins:dateOfBirth
  autoins:dataClassification autoins:SensitivePersonalData ;
  autoins:accessLevel autoins:StaffAccess ;
  autoins:retentionPeriod "P7Y" ;
  autoins:obfuscationMethod autoins:PartialMasking .
```

**Principle**: GDPR compliance built into the ontology at field level, not added as an afterthought.

**Features**:
- **Data Classification**: Every field tagged with GDPR category
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions defined in ontology
- **Retention Management**: Automatic data lifecycle management
- **Right to Erasure**: Built-in anonymization and deletion capabilities

## 🏗️ **Architecture Deep Dive**

### **Layer 1: Presentation (React/TypeScript)**
```typescript
// UI components driven by ontology metadata
const DriverForm = ({ ontology, driver, updateDriver }) => {
  const fields = ontology.getFieldsForClass('autoins:Driver');
  return fields.map(field => 
    <FormField 
      key={field.property}
      definition={field}
      value={driver[field.property]}
      onChange={(value) => updateDriver(field.property, value)}
      validation={ontology.getSHACLRules(field.property)}
    />
  );
};
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Ontology-Driven**: UI structure generated from TTL definitions
- **Real-time Validation**: SHACL rules enforced in browser
- **i18n Support**: Labels and help text from ontology language tags
- **Accessibility**: Semantic markup improves screen reader compatibility

### **Layer 2: Business Services (Go Microservices)**
```go
// Services implement ontology-defined business logic
type ReserveCalculator struct {
    ontology *OntologyGraph
    rules    *SHACLValidator
}

func (rc *ReserveCalculator) Calculate(claim Claim) (ReserveResult, error) {
    // Validate input against SHACL shapes
    if err := rc.rules.Validate(claim); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    // Apply business rules from ontology
    base := rc.ontology.GetSeverityAmount(claim.LossType, claim.VehicleACV)
    modifiers := rc.ontology.GetRiskModifiers(claim)
    
    return ReserveResult{
        Base: base,
        Modifiers: modifiers,
        Total: base + modifiers.Sum(),
        Citations: rc.ontology.GetFactIRIs(claim),
    }, nil
}
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Stateless Services**: Each service independently validates and processes
- **Ontology Integration**: Business logic derived from TTL definitions
- **Audit Trails**: Every operation records fact sources and calculations
- **Error Handling**: SHACL violations produce structured error responses

### **Layer 3: Knowledge Management (TTL + SHACL)**
```turtle
# Business rule expressed as semantic constraint
autoins:ClaimAmountValidation a sh:NodeShape ;
  sh:targetClass autoins:Claim ;
  sh:property [
    sh:path autoins:claimAmount ;
    sh:datatype xsd:decimal ;
    sh:minInclusive 0.01 ;
    sh:maxInclusive 1000000.00 ;
    sh:message "Claim amount must be between £0.01 and £1,000,000" ;
    autoins:businessRule "CLAIM_AMOUNT_LIMITS" ;
    autoins:regulatoryBasis "FCA ICOBS 8.1.1" ;
  ] .
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Formal Semantics**: Business rules expressed in W3C standards
- **Regulatory Mapping**: Rules linked to specific legal requirements
- **Version Control**: Ontology changes tracked like source code
- **Reasoning Support**: OWL inference enables advanced logic

### **Layer 4: Data Persistence (RDF + Documents)**
```sparql
# Query for grounded AI responses
SELECT ?claim ?amount ?policy ?coverage WHERE {
  ?claim a autoins:Claim ;
         autoins:claimAmount ?amount ;
         autoins:relatesToPolicy ?policy .
  ?policy autoins:coverageLimit ?coverage .
  FILTER(?amount <= ?coverage)
}
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Graph Database**: RDF triples store semantic relationships
- **Document Store**: Binary documents (PDFs, images) with metadata
- **Session Management**: Temporary data for user interactions
- **Audit Logging**: Immutable record of all system operations
