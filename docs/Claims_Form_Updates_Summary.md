# Claims Form Updates Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Capitalization Issue ✅
- **Fixed**: "Manual Or Automatic Entitlement" → "Manual or Automatic Entitlement"
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `AI_Driver_Details.ttl`
  - `AI_Driver_Licence_Schema.ttl`
- **Rule Applied**: Don't uppercase conjunctions like "or", "and", etc.

### 2. Added Prominent Warning About Additional Drivers ✅
- **Updated**: Claims section help text now includes prominent warning
- **New Text**: "⚠️ IMPORTANT: Have you or any named driver had accidents/claims while driving ANY vehicle in the last 5 years? This includes claims made under other policies. Remember: ALL claims affect the main driver's record and No Claims Bonus, regardless of who was driving."
- **Purpose**: Makes it crystal clear that all claims go on the main driver's record

### 3. Added "Main Driver Was Driving?" Checkbox ✅
- **New Field**: `autoins:mainDriverWasDriving`
- **Type**: Radio buttons (YES/NO)
- **Conditional Display**: Only shows when:
  - `hasAccidents=YES AND driverType!=MAIN_DRIVER`
- **Logic**: If someone is filling out the form as the main driver, this question doesn't appear (because obviously the main driver was driving their own form)
- **Help Text**: "Confirm: Was the main driver (policy holder) driving at the time of this accident/claim? (This claim will still go on the main driver's record regardless)"

### 4. Enhanced Frontend Conditional Logic ✅
- **Added**: Support for `AND` conditions in conditional display
- **Previous**: Only supported `OR` conditions and single conditions
- **New**: Now supports complex conditions like `hasAccidents=YES AND driverType!=MAIN_DRIVER`
- **Implementation**: Uses `every()` for AND conditions, `some()` for OR conditions

### 5. GDPR Compliance Verification ✅
- **Confirmed**: All ontology files have proper GDPR flags:
  - `autoins:dataClassification` (PersonalData, SensitivePersonalData)
  - `autoins:gdprCompliant "true"`
  - `autoins:consentRequired "true"`
  - `autoins:retentionPeriod` specifications
- **Coverage**: 193 GDPR compliance annotations found across all ontology files

## Technical Implementation

### Conditional Display Logic
```turtle
autoins:mainDriverWasDriving a owl:DatatypeProperty ;
  autoins:conditionalDisplay "hasAccidents=YES AND driverType!=MAIN_DRIVER" ;
```

### Frontend AND Logic
```typescript
// Handle AND conditions like "hasAccidents=YES AND driverType!=MAIN_DRIVER"
if (condition.includes(' AND ')) {
  const andConditions = condition.split(' AND ');
  return andConditions.every(andCondition => evaluateCondition(andCondition.trim(), data));
}
```

## User Experience Impact

1. **Clearer Messaging**: Users now see prominent warnings about how additional drivers affect claims
2. **Smarter Forms**: The "Main Driver Was Driving?" question only appears when relevant (for named/occasional drivers)
3. **Better Attribution**: System captures who was actually driving while maintaining that claims go on main driver's record
4. **Compliance**: All data properly classified for GDPR compliance

## Key Insight Implemented

**Claims follow the policy, not the driver** - This is now clearly communicated to users while still capturing individual driver attribution for risk assessment purposes.

## Files Modified
- `client-ux/ontology/AI_Driver_Details.ttl`
- `client-ux/ontology/AI_Driver_Licence_Schema.ttl`
- `client-ux/insurance-frontend/src/components/forms/UniversalForm.tsx`

## Testing
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ Server started on http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Ready for user testing of new conditional logic and claims warnings
